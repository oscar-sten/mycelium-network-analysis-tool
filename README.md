## Remarks
The branch/crossing detection and branch/crossing matching tests are
not fully automated, since a couple of cases were too complicated to 
annotate. In these cases the person performing the test must determine 
visually is the algorithm's assessment is correct or not.

1) In image `s.jpg` there is a crossing in the bottom left corner whose
 matching must be assessed manually. Running 
`branch_crossing_matching_test.m` with the parameters reported in the
 manuscript makes this crossing wrongly matched, so one "fault"
 must be added.

2) In image`o.jpg`, a filament in the top right corner traverses
 multiple structures and must be assessed maunally.  Running 
`branch_crossing_identification_test_2.m` with the parameters 
reported in the manuscript makes this crossing not detected, so one
 "false negative" must be added.
